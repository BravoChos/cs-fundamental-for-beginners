# THE VALUE OF SELF-TESTING CODE

Make sure all tests are fully automatic and that they check their own results.

A suite of tests is a powerful bug detector that decapitates the time it takes to find bugs.

## Example

```
npm install
cd ./example
npm test
```

## Tips

Always make sure a test will fail when it should.

Run tests frequently. Run those exercising the code you’re working on at least every few minutes; run all tests at least daily.
