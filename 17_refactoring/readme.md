# Refactoring

by Martin Fowler

## Rule #1.

> When you have to add a feature to a program but the code is not structured in
> a convenient way, first refactor the program to make it easy to add the feature, then
> add the feature.

## Rule #2.

> Before you start refactoring, make sure you have a solid suite of tests. These
> tests must be selfchecking.

## Rule #3.

> Refactoring changes the programs in small steps, so if you make a mistake, it
> is easy to find where the bug is.

## Rule #4.

> Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers
> write code that humans can understand.

## Rule #5.

> When programming, follow the camping rule: Always leave the code base
> healthier than when you found it.
