# 4 Principles of Object-Oriented Programming

The four principles of object-oriented programming (abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism) are features that - if used properly - can help us write more testable, flexible, and maintainable code.

1. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is accomplished when each object maintains a private state, inside a class. Other objects can not access this state directly, instead, they can only invoke a list of public functions.

The object manages its own state via these functions and no other class can alter it unless explicitly allowed.

In order to communicate with the object, you will need to utilize the methods provided.

2. Abstraction

Abstraction is an extension of encapsulation. It is the process of selecting data from a larger pool to show only the relevant details to the object.

One of the advantages of Abstraction is being able to apply the same information you used for the dating application to other applications with little or no modification.

3. Inheritance

Inheritance is the ability of one object to acquire some/all properties of another object. With inheritance, reusability is a major advantage.

4. Polymorphism (= Many Form)

Polymorphism gives us a way to use a class exactly like its parent so there is no confusion with mixing types. This being said, each child sub-class keeps its own functions/methods as they are.
