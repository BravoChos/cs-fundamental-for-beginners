# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP is a programming `paradigm` based on the concept of 'object' which can contain `data` and `code`.

## Imperative and Procedural Programming

### Disadvantages of Procedural Programming

- The program code is harder to understand and write when Procedural Programming is employed.
- The Procedural code is often not reusable, which may pose the need to recreate the code if is needed to use in another application.
- Difficult to relate with real-world objects.
- Hard to maintain the code.

### Advantage of OOP

- Re-usablility
- Data Redundancy
- Code maintenance
- Security: by use of data hiding and absstractio mechanism
- Easy troubleshooting
- Polymorphism Flexibility
- Productivity, High Quality, Faster Development

## Class

- template
- declare once
- no data in

## Object

- insance of a class
- created many times
- data in
