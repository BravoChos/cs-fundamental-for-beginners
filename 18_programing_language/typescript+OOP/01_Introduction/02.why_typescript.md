# Why typescript?

1. Support Type!

There are two main types in rogramming languages: dynamically typed and statically typed.

Dynamically typed has no type at programming runtime and compile time. It's easy to use, more flexibile, and has fast development cycles but low readability.

In Statically typed language, type of variable is known at compile time. Its provdes protection from Runtime errors and can get IDE Assistance.

2. Support OOP!

OOP is morden programing paridiam and TS support OOP better then JS!

OOP provides

- modularity
- resuability
- extensibile
- maintability

which leads productivity, higher-quality, faster developemnt!
